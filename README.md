# Dotfiles
Speed up the boarding process. The concept of organization is based on Zach Holman's dotfiles at https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.

## Getting started
1. `$ cd` to the directory you want your dotfiles to live in.
2. Clone this repo `$ git clone https://github.com/moritzhaller/dotfiles.git ./.dotfiles`.
3. Cd to the dotfiles directory `cd ./dotfiles`.
3. Create symlinks by running `./script/install` and following the instructions.

## Assumptions
These dotfiles are ment to work with bash under OSX.
